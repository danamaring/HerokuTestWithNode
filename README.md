# Project 2: PRODUCT PROMO APP
Design a simple one-page app with NodeJS and Express. Integrate with Heroku and host it live using your Heroku account and the command line build tools. 

## Description

Design a mobile-first one page web application that highlights any product you like. Use images, video, 3D - anything at all. You can create a product of your own if you like (feel free to make it as over-the-top as you want).

Use modern tools and techniques to generate the required assets. Use a Github repo that is also integrated with Heroku to host and deploy your app (host it on Heroku, manage it on Github, continuously deploy it to Heroku).

Use Node and Express to generate the app; send the HTML file as your response via the route. Include the Heroku remote, push changes / branches live and submit your repo link as well as the Heroku app link.
